# TODO List

These are a collection of features that need to be implemented, modified, or otherwise corrected.

Feature  | File | Reason
---------|------|-------------
Hand.selectCard() | card_functions.py | needs to be changed to deal with duplicate card values. Right now it will just select the first matching if you only enter the value.
confirm_integer() | card_functions.py | currently takes any integer, needs to be able to confirm if negative or positive (ie how many decks), as well as a cap (ie how many cards there can be in x decks)
blackjack_game.py | blackjack_game.py | needs to be created, most likely will need expanding on the blackjack_functions.py
