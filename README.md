#### DISCLAIMER: It is NOT ILLEGAL to count cards on a table in Las Vegas, HOWEVER, it IS illegal to use an apparatus outside of your own mind (devices, etc) while at a table. Please use discretion and understand that this is a mental exercise. This is not designed for use at a Vegas table, but rather to prepare your mind before going to a table.


###### This is a BlackJack trainer. It trains the user on how to count cards using the High/Low or Revere(Plus/Minus) method of counting

        2, 3, 4, 5, 6 -> +1
        7, 8, 9 -> +0
        10, Jack, Queen, King, Ace -> -1

###### Usage
-----

To run the trainer:

	python count_trainer.py

Once running, just enter a name, it then randomly displays 1-104 cards with a delay. Afterwards it will ask for the count, and inform you if correct. To play again, just run it again.
